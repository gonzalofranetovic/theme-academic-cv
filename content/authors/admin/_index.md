I am a **PhD Candidate** in **Sociology and Social Research Methodology** at the **University of Milan**. I obtained my B.A. and M.A. in Sociology from the Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile. 

My research agenda focuses on **comprehending how people understand social inequality**. In my ongoing doctoral dissertation I explore **how socioeconomic segregation within individuals' social environments influences their attitudes towards inequality**, with an emphasis on perceptions of inequality and preferences for redistribution. I am excited about the opportunity to contribute meaningfully to the understanding of these complex social dynamics. 

Throughout my academic and professional journey, I have actively engaged in diverse roles within universities, research centers, and public institutions. My experience encompasses **undergraduate teaching, social research, and data analysis**, with a primary focus on **inequality, social mobility, social stratification, and quantitative methods**. I have served as a **research assistant** on various projects. In one instance, I analyzed the impact of specific university careers on social mobility patterns and elite reproduction in Chile. In another, I explored in depth the study of the theoretical approaches to distributive and procedural justice. Lastly, I investigated the determinants of preferences for redistribution in Latin America, utilizing a longitudinal and multilevel approach.
