I am a PhD Candidate in Sociology and Social Research Methodology at the University of Milan. I obtained my B.A. and M.A. in Sociology from the Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile. 

My research agenda focuses on comprehending how people understand social inequality. In my ongoing doctoral dissertation I explore how socioeconomic segregation within individuals' social environments influences their attitudes towards inequality, with an emphasis on perceptions of inequality and preferences for redistribution. I am excited about the opportunity to contribute meaningfully to the understanding of these complex social dynamics. 

My background includes serving as an undergraduate professor in sociological theory and quantitative methods, contributing to the academic development of students. Additionally, I have worked as a socioeconomic data analyst at the National Statistics Institute of Chile, where I honed my skills in interpreting and analyzing complex datasets. I take pride in having my work featured in esteemed journals such as Frontiers in Sociology and the Spanish Journal of Sociology.
