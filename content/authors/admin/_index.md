I am Gonzalo, a **Postdoctoral Research Fellow** at the **[Laboratory for the Computational Analysis of Egonetworks, Social Cohesion, and Exclusion (COALESCE Lab)](http://coalesce-lab.com/en)** at the **[Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona](https://www.uab.cat/)**.

I recently completed my **PhD in Sociology and Methodology of Social Research** at the **[University of Milan](https://www.unimi.it/en)**, where I was affiliated with the **[Department of Social and Political Sciences](https://www.unimi.it/en/ugov/ou-structure/department-social-and-political-sciences)** and the **[NASP – Network for the Advancement of Social and Political Studies](https://www.nasp.eu/)**.

Previously, I was a **Postdoctoral Research Fellow** at the **[University of Turin](https://en.unito.it/)**, and a **Visiting Fellow** at both the **[Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona](https://www.uab.cat/)** and the **[University of Chile](https://uchile.cl/)**. I am also affiliated with the **[Research Lab on Social and Political Change (SPSTrend)](https://www.spstrend.it/)** and the **[Chilean Society for Social Network Science](https://www.chisocnet.org/)**.

**My research examines how people understand social inequalities and how these are reproduced, reinforced, or contested through social relationships.** I focus on both social stratification (objective inequalities) and distributive justice research (subjective inequalities).

In my doctoral dissertation, I examined how the socioeconomic composition of individuals' social environments shapes their attitudes towards inequality, with an emphasis on personal networks and socializing institutions like schools and neighborhoods. I addressed this through cross-country data, complex network methods, and a life course perspective, analyzing variations across social positions.

My work has been [published](/#publications) in **[Network Science](https://doi.org/10.1017/nws.2025.10004)**, **[Social Indicators Research](https://doi.org/10.1007/s11205-024-03352-5)**, **[Frontiers in Sociology](https://doi.org/10.3389/fsoc.2022.806458)**, and **[Spanish Journal of Sociology](https://doi.org/10.22325/fes/res.2020.33)**, among others, addressing inequality, social mobility, and distributive justice through methods including network analysis, longitudinal and multilevel approaches, and comparative research.

I have gained [teaching](/#teaching) experience doing undergraduate courses on sociological theory, inequality, economic sociology, and quantitative methods at **[Collegio Carlo Alberto](https://www.carloalberto.org/)**, **[Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile](https://www.uc.cl/)**, **[Alberto Hurtado University](https://www.uahurtado.cl/)**, and **[San Sebastian University](https://www.uss.cl/)**. I have also worked as a Socioeconomic Analyst at the **[National Statistics Institute of Chile](https://www.ine.cl/)**.

You can find more about my [publications](/#publications), [work in progress](/#projects), and [teaching](/#teaching) on this site.
