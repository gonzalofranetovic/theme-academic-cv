I am Gonzalo, a **Postdoctoral Researcher** at the **[Laboratory for the Computational Analysis of Egonetworks, Social Cohesion, and Exclusion (COALESCE Lab)](http://coalesce-lab.com/en)** at the **[Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona](https://www.uab.cat/)**. **My research examines how people understand social inequalities and how these are reproduced, reinforced, or contested through social relationships.** I focus on both **social stratification** (objective inequalities) and **distributive justice research** (subjective inequalities).

I completed my **[PhD in Sociology and Methodology of Social Research](https://www.unimi.it/en/education/postgraduate-and-continuing-education-programmes/doctoral-programmes-phd/ay-2024/2025-sociology-and-methodology-social-research)** at the **[University of Milan](https://www.unimi.it/en)**, where I examined how the socioeconomic composition of individuals' social environments shapes their attitudes towards inequality, with an emphasis on personal networks and socializing institutions like schools and neighborhoods. I addressed this through cross-country data, complex network methods, and a life course perspective, analyzing variations across social positions.

My work has been [published](/#publications) in **[Network Science](https://doi.org/10.1017/nws.2025.10004)**, **[Social Indicators Research](https://doi.org/10.1007/s11205-024-03352-5)**, **[Frontiers in Sociology](https://doi.org/10.3389/fsoc.2022.806458)**, and **[Spanish Journal of Sociology](https://doi.org/10.22325/fes/res.2020.33)**, among others, addressing inequality, social mobility, and distributive justice through methods including network analysis, longitudinal and multilevel approaches, and comparative research. I have gained [teaching](/#teaching) experience doing undergraduate courses on **sociological theory, inequality, economic sociology, and quantitative methods** in Europe and Latin America. I have also worked as a Socioeconomic Analyst at the **[National Statistics Institute of Chile](https://www.ine.cl/)**.

You can find more about my [publications](/#publications), [work in progress](/#projects), and [teaching](/#teaching) on this site.
