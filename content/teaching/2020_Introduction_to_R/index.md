abstract: In this series of capsules you will learn some basic tools for data processing with R. Several of the topics reviewed are part of the daily work within the INE. The videos are ordered progressively, that is, from least to greatest complexity, however, they were designed with a self-contained logic, so that you can review each of them independently. We wish you much success in your learning
