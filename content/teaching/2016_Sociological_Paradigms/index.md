abstract: The purpose of the course is to introduce students to the founding question of sociology about the conditions that make social ties possible. This question is approached from a theoretically and historically grounded perspective. The course allows us to understand the main paradigms from which an attempt has been made to answer the question about the conditions of possibility of the social bond, constituting itself as an introductory course to sociological theory.
