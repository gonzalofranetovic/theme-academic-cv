abstract: The recognition of an insufficiency in the methodological training of those who face the daily challenge of observing, knowing and transforming social reality is based on the perception that social issues have become increasingly complex and difficult to understand; in a context of accelerated modernization, traditional tools for this purpose seem to have lost their effectiveness. For this reason, the course is oriented to provide a series of technical skills for the collection and analysis of simple and complex data using computer tools.
