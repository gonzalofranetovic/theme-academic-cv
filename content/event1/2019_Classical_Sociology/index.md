abstract: Theoretical subject belonging to the complementary curricular line, dictated in the first semester of the course. It is proposed that the student of Social Work acquires a broad vision of classical sociology, understanding theories that develop the different sociological currents and how these are transformed into tools to interpret social reality, social problems and their tensions. At the end of the course, students will be able to explain the classical sociological currents, relating them to contemporary social problems.
