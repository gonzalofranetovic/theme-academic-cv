PhD student in Sociology and Methodology of Social Research at the University of Milan. BA and MA in Sociology from the Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile. Currently, in my doctoral thesis project, I am analyzing the effect of socioeconomic heterogeneity of people's social environments on their attitudes towards inequality in contemporary societies. My research interests are related to distributive justice; social stratification; quantitative research methods; attitudes towards inequality, redistribution and welfare states; economic sociology; and international comparative research.
